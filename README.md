# RubyCar

Made a MyCar api with Ruby.

This is very basic.

Here are some examples on how to make a new car and the commands associated with it.

toyota.MyCar.new(year, color, model, gallons_in_tank)

toyota.look_at => Look at your new car!
.speed_up => Speed up by 10 kph
.brake => slow down by 10kph
.shut_off => turn off your car
.turn_on => start your car
.drive(distance) => drive a certain amount of distance. This will also return your car's mileage.
